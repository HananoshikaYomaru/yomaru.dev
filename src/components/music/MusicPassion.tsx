        I have a huge love of music and I listen to a lot of them. I listened to
        almost every genre of music, from classical music to hard rock, from
        western styles to eastern styles. I had a huge Apple music library and
        it keeps growing every day. Some of my favorite genres are international
        pop, Japanese pop and movie soundtracks. I often share my playlists with
        my friends and they are impressed by the broadness of genres I like.
        Therefore I want to share them with you.

        Let me be honest, I am a musical instrument handicap. I have learned
        piano and flute before but somehow I failed to synchronize my hands with
        the notes and beats. But that doesnâ€™t stop me from learning musical
        instruments. I played a music VR game called Beat Saber and found that I
        am quite talented in the game. I guess I am quite good at counting beats
        and seems like I can control my arms better than control my fingers. So
        I chose a relatively easy instrument which is the cajon. I also like
        singing (but my voice is surely not as good as a pro singer). I hope we
        can found some common interest in music.
